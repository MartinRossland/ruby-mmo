Ruby MMO
========

Ruby MMO is a programming challenge in which players compete to gain the highest level in an MMO simulation.

How to play
-----------

Fork this repo and commit a module inside the `/players` directory. The module is then used to extend a player object with a couple of methods:

1. The `move` method returns an array with two elements: the method to be called (can be one of `:attack` or `:rest`), and the method arguments. In the case of `:attack` the argument should be an instance of an opponent Player (see below for how to get this). In the case of `:rest` no argument is required. See the examples in the `/players` directory.

2. `to_s` (optional) returns the name of the player.

Order of Play
-------------

The player order is shuffled each round. If multiple players attack the same opponent, the attacks are grouped so that the largest group attacks first and then remaining attackers are random (thanks to @iyonius).

Levelling Up
------------

For each conquered opponent, the attacker gains the amount of experience equal to the opponent's max health. Group attackers split the experience equally. If a player's experience crosses the threshold for levelling up, that player's max health, strength, and defence will all be increased (according to the schedule in `engine/player.rb`).

Exploring
---------

The player modules have access to the `Game.world` hash. This hash contains all the players and monsters in the world and their current stats. For example, to get the stats of a random player you could do:

    player_count = Game.world[:players].count
    opponent = Game.world[:players].select{|p|p != self}[rand(player_count - 1)]
    opponent.stats

The `select` is to ensure the player is not fighting itself.

There is also a method `alive` that returns false if the player is dead.

Rules
-----

1. No cheating by overriding classes, methods, or instance variables.
2. Cheating players will be moved to the cheaters/ directory.

@DanKnox came up with a dominating technique that involves dynamically creating multiple player modules. In order to mitigate the strength of this technique, a third rule seems necessary:

3. No more than 3 player instances per Github account.

Running the simulation
----------------------

`./engine.rb -r 100` where `-r` sets the number of rounds (default is 10).

Winning
-------

The player with the highest level and experience wins.
